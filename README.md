# Python example for DNB Open Banking APIs

## Note
The original is found at https://github.com/DNBbank/getting-started
This is pretty much just a quick hack to make the getting started example code work with Python3.

## Usage

Open the secret_example.py file and add your ID, secret and key. Rename the file to 'secret.py', and run 'getting_started.py'

The following information is required in 'secret.py':
```
CLIENT_ID=
CLIENT_SECRET=
API_KEY=
```

Please see https://github.com/DNBbank/getting-started for more information regarding code structure.
